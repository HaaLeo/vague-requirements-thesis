Requirement engineering is an integral part of the modern software engineering process.
Within this process many faults can occur which can cost a lot of time an money in the following development steps \parencite{Mendez:2016}.
Therefore, one should strive to identify misleading requirements as soon as possible.

With this thesis we contribute a dataset of requirements which are labeled as vague or not-vague.
Further, we evaluate whether and to what extent state of the art transformer-based machine learning models are capable to classify requirements.
These models are vanilla implementations of different transformers and should be considered as baseline for future research.

Our models achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.5$.
We conclude that further steps must be taken until transformer-based models can compete with traditional rule-based approaches.
