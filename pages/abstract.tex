Requirement engineering is an integral part of the modern software engineering process.
Within this process many faults can occur which can cost a lot of time an money in the following development steps \parencite{Mendez:2016}.
Therefore, one should strive to identify misleading requirements as soon as possible.

Traditional approaches try to identify bad requirements based upon different rule sets.
However, machine learning achieved remarkable results on different natural language processing tasks.
Therefore, we want to explore whether and to what extent state of the art machine learning approaches are capable to uncover bad requirements.

With this thesis we contribute a dataset of requirements which are labeled as vague or not-vague.
Further, we evaluate whether and to what extent transformer-based machine learning models are capable to classify requirements.
These models are vanilla implementations of different transformers and should be considered as baseline for future research.

Our models achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.5$.
We conclude that further steps must be taken until transformer-based models can compete with traditional rule-based approaches.
