Requirement engineering is an integral part of the modern software engineering process.
Within this process many mistakes can occur which cost a lot of time and money in the subsequent development steps.
Therefore, one should strive to identify misleading requirements as soon as possible.

Traditional approaches try to identify misleading requirements based upon different rule sets.
However, machine learning achieved remarkable results on different natural language processing tasks.
Therefore, we want to explore whether and to what extent state of the art machine learning approaches are capable of uncovering problematic requirements.

With this thesis we contribute a dataset of requirements which are labeled as vague or not-vague.
Further, we evaluate the ability of transformer-based machine learning models to classify requirements.
These models are vanilla implementations of different transformers and should be considered as baseline for future research.

Our models achieve an $F_1$ score of $0.5$ which is worse than the performance of other rule-based approaches
We conclude that further steps must be taken until transformer\nobreakdash-based models can compete with traditional approaches.
