\chapter{Threats to Validity}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity}
In the prior chapters we introduced a transformer-based approach to classify requirements as vague or not-vague.
We used it to conduct a study whose result is that transformer-based models must be further enhanced in order to be used as reliable requirement predictors.
In this chapter we therefore want to elaborate possible threats to the study's validity.
