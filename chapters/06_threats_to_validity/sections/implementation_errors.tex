\section{Implementation Errors}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity:sec:implementation_errors}

We have written hundreds lines of code for the study execution and its evaluation.
The code was tested manually as well as by unit tests.
The implementation follows the study design and we removed all flaws we found.
Nevertheless, there remains a small chance that the implemented program still contains mistakes made either by the author or included in third party software libraries we use.
Since we cannot guarantee that all components of our program are flawless, this is a valid threat to the validity.
