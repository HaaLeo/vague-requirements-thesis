\section{Hyperparameter Grid}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity:sec:hyperparameter_grid}

The hyperparameters used for the training pose another threat.
Finding suitable hyperparameters is very challenging \parencite{Zeiler:2012} and has became its own research field.
In our study we aim to determine fitting hyperparameters with a rather simple grid search.
With this technique one can detect the best hyperparameter configuration of the earlier defined hyperparameter grid, but we do not know how suitable the chosen grids themselves are.
Although we created hyperparameter grids based on the recommendations of the models' authors, it is likely that we obtained suboptimal hyperparameters leading to worse training and consequently to less performant models.
Therefore, the suboptimal hyperparameters are a threat as well.
