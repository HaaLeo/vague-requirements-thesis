\section{Dataset Quality}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity:sec:dataset_quality}

The first valid concern raising is the datasets' quality.
Although we define a quality condition to ensure a dataset's quality which is quite intuitive, the condition is arbitrary similar to the thresholds defined by \textcite{Landis:1977}.
This means that that even our crowdsourced dataset meets the condition it is questionable whether the condition itself is sufficient for a high quality dataset.
However, this concern is only valid for a part of our dataset.
The portion $D_{manual}$ is excluded from this threat, because it was labeled by an expert.
Further, our dataset is imbalanced.
For example $D_{all}$ consists of $21\%$ vague datapoints.
Although we took this imbalance into account by applying a re-sampling strategy on the training dataset, the vagueness could still be underrepresented in our dataset and consequently harder to learn by the models.
