\section{Downstream Classifier}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity:sec:downstream_classifier}

This threat concerns the approach.
All three models output multiple tokens whose first one can be used for downstream classification tasks \parencite{Devlin:2018}.
For this downstream classification we used a fully connected feed forward \ac{NN} with 1,538 learnable parameters.
Using a low-parameter \ac{NN} harbors the the risk that it cannot map the vagueness' complexity to the correct label.
Since we cannot preclude that the downstream \ac{NN} is incapable for this specific classification task, this is considered as a threat to validity.
