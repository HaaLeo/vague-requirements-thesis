\section{Parameter Grid}
\label{chp:threats_to_validity:sec:parameter_grid}

The hyperparameters used for the training pose another threat.
Finding suitable hyperparameters is very challenging \parencite{Zeiler:2012} and has became its own research field.
In our study we aim to determine good hyperparameters with a rather simple grid search.
With this technique one can detect the best parameter configuration of the earlier defined parameter, but we do not know how good the parameter grid itself is.
Although we created a parameter grid based on the recommendations of the models' authors, it is likely that we obtained not optimal hyperparameters which can lead to worse training and consequently to less performant models.
Therefore, the not optimal hyperparameters are a threat as well.
