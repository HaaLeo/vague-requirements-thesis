\chapter{Future Work}
\label{chp:future_work}
As we describe in \cref{chp:study:sec:interpretation}, our transformer-based approaches perform rather poor.
Further, the study includes several threats to validity.
On the other hand, this poses various opportunities for future research.
In this chapter we propose different research directions which further examines how suitable transformer-based models are to uncover vague requirements.
