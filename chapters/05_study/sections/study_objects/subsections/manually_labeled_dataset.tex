\subsection{Manually Labeled Dataset}
\label{chp:study:sec:study_objects:dataset_creation:manual_labeling}
The crowdsourced dataset introduced in \cref{chp:study:sec:study_objects:crowdsourced_dataset} resulted in discarding a major part of the source dataset's requirements.
To avoid this data loss we decide to manually label the requirements which were discarded when generating $D_{crowd}$.
This dataset is called $D_{manual}$ and includes of all the remaining 1228 requirements.
It was labeled by the author of this thesis as an expert and consists of 301 as \textit{vague} labeled requirements and 927 requirements with \textit{not-vague} annotations.
Further, we want to introduce the union of those two datasets as $D_{all} = D_{crowd} \cup D_{manual}$.
All study objects and their properties are shown in \cref{tab:study:objects:all_datasets}

From \cref{tab:study:objects:all_datasets} one observers that all datasets contain a rather little amount of vague labeled requirements.
The exact proportion of vague labels within a dataset is heavily coupled to the dataset's requirements, not to the rater/s who labeled it.
Throughout the whole labelling process we aimed to obtain datasets whose quality is as close as possible to an expert dataset.
Since $D_{manuall}$ was labeled by an expert we assume its quality is rather high.
