% Introduction paragraph
Training and evaluation of our transformer-based models requires a labeled dataset in the form of a set of requirements which are each either labeled as vague or not-vague.
However, to the extent of our knowledge there does not exist a publicly available dataset which fulfills this specification.
Therefore, it is necessary to create a suitable dataset ourselves.
Although there does not exist a dataset which satisfies our needs, we can fall back to a set of 2,776 unique requirements \parencite{Kummeth:2020} and base our dataset upon it.
In the next two subsections we present \textit{how} we create \textit{which} datasets.
