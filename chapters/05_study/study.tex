\chapter{Study}
\label{chp:study}

In this chapter the conducted study is presented.
As first step we formulate a precise research question which the study aims to answer, following that the study Design is laid out in detail.
Since \ac{ML} algorithms depend so heavily on the data we then carefully present the dataset and its properties in the section \nameref{chp:study:sec:study_objects}.
In the next section we focus on the study's \textit{\nameref{chp:study:sec:execution}} and pay special attention to hyperparameters used in the \ac{ML} models.
After that we show the \textit{\nameref{chp:study:sec:results}}.
In the last section we give an \textit{\nameref{chp:study:sec:interpretation}} of the results.
