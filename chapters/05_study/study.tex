\chapter{Study}
\label{chp:study}

In this chapter the conducted study is presented.
As first step we formulate a precise research question which the study aims to answer, following that the study design is laid out in detail.
Since \ac{ML} algorithms depend so heavily on the data we then carefully present the dataset and its properties in \cref{chp:study:sec:study_objects}.
In the subsequent section we focus on the study's \textit{execution} and pay special attention to the hyperparameters used in the \ac{ML} models.
After that we show the \textit{results}.
In the last section we give an \textit{interpretation} of the results.
