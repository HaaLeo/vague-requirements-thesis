\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{chp:fundamentals}

This chapter aims to establish the fundamental knowledge which is required to understand this thesis.
First we will introduce vagueness in the context of \ac{RE} to specify what we consider a vague requirement.
After that, we present a method named crowdsourcing to rapidly generate a labeled dataset.
To evaluate whether transformers are capable to classify vague requirements we use dedicated metrics which are explained in \cref{chp:fundamentals:sec:metrics}.
Since our chosen approach bases on state of the art \ac{ML} concepts and \acp{DNN} we explain those in \cref{chp:fundamentals:sec:machine_learning}.
As last part of the fundamentals we introduce \ac{IRA} in \cref{chp:fundamentals:sec:inter_rater_agreement} in order to judge the quality of an annotated dataset.
