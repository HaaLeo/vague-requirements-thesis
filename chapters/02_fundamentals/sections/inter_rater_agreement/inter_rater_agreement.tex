\section{Inter Rater Agreement}
\label{chp:fundamentals:sec:inter_rater_agreement}
Many \ac{ML} models require a dataset which is used to train the models.
This data is often generated by multiple raters which assign a label to each datapoint.
The used dataset directly influences the \ac{ML} model \parencite{Gray:2011} and therefore, well designed research studies must include mechanisms to capture \ac{IRA} \parencite{McHugh:2012}.

This chapter gives an introduction to different \ac{IRA} metrics and their applications.
