\section{Machine Learning}
\label{chp:fundamentals:sec:machine_learning}
In this section we want to introduce the state of the art \ac{ML} concepts needed throughout this thesis.

We presume that the reader has basic knowledge in the domain of \ac{ML} and \acp{NN}.
If one wishes to brush up his or her knowledge in those domains we recommend \citeauthor{Alpaydin:2020}'s Introduction to Machine Learning \parencite{Alpaydin:2020}.
Here we only want to close the gap between basic \ac{ML} concepts and state of the art techniques.
