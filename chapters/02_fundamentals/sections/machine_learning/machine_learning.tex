\section{Machine Learning}
\label{chp:fundamentals:sec:machine_learning}
In this section we want to establish the fundamentals regarding \ac{ML} needed throughout this thesis.
We presume that the reader has basic knowledge on the domain of \ac{ML} and \acp{NN}.
If one wishes to brush up his/her knowledge on this domains we recommend \citeauthor{Alpaydin:2020}'s Introduction to Machine Learning \parencite{Alpaydin:2020}.
Instead, here we want to close the gap between basic \ac{ML} concepts and state of the art techniques.
