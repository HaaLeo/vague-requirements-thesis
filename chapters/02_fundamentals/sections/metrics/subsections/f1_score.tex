\subsection{F1 Score}
\label{chp:fundamentals:sec:metrics:subsec:f1_score}

We previously introduced the two metrics \textit{precision} and \textit{recall}.
From their definition in \cref{eq:precision} and \cref{eq:recall} concludes immediately that both are only optimal if an algorithm manages to select \textit{exclusively} \ac{TP} which would lead to $prec = rec = 1$.
However, in most scenarios there is a trade-off among whether one wants to identify all available relevant items (recall) or all of the selected items should be relevant (precision).
Here we do not focus on the formal derivation of this well known trade-off, instead excellent derivations can be found in \textcites{Gordon:1989}{Zhu:2004}.
To measure and express this trade-off one can build the \textit{harmonic mean} of precision and recall which is called \textit{F1 score} \parencite{Powers:2011}.
This metric is defined by the following equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:f1_score}
    F_1 = 2 \frac{prec \cdot rec}{prec+rec}
\end{equation}

For the example data of \cref{fig:metrics:tp_vis} its algorithm achieves an F$_1$ score of $F_1 = 2 \frac{\frac{3}{7} \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{3}{7}+\frac{1}{4}}$.
