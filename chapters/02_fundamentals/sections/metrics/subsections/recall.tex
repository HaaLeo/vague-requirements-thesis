\subsection{Recall}
\label{chp:fundamentals:sec:metrics:subsec:Recall}

The next metric we introduce is called \textit{recall} and is defined \textit{"as the probability of detecting an item given that it is relevant"} \parencite{Zhu:2004}.
Its formula is given by \cref{eq:recall}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:recall}
    rec = \frac{\acp{TP}}{\acp{TP}+\acp{FN}}
\end{equation}

This metric expresses the performance of an algorithm in terms of how many of all relevant items it manages to select.
However, irrelevant items which may have been incorrectly selected are not be penalized.
Therefore, an algorithm which simply selects \textit{all} available items always achieves a recall $rec=1$.
For the data shown in \cref{fig:metrics:tp_vis}, the corresponding algorithm achieves a recall of $rec = \frac{3}{3+9} = 0.25$.
