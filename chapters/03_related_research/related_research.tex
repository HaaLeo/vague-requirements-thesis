Identifying defects in requirements is an active and ongoing research field.
This chapter presents different approaches that tackle this challenge.
The approaches are categorized regarding the mechanism they utilize to solve the task.
It is distinguished among \textit{rule based}, \textit{\ac{ML} based} and \textit{hybrid} approaches. % TODO Wirklich auch Hybride Ans√§tze?

Rule-based approaches are one of the most often used approaches to tackle \ac{NLP} tasks in the context of \ac{RE}.
An approach is called rule-based approach when rules or facts represent the linguistic expertise. \parencite{Zhao:2020}
